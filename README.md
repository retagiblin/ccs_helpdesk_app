# ccs_helpdesk_app

This application was developed for the class Visual Analytics in the Master of Data Science program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.  The application uses real data from the IT department at a church & school where I worked for several years.  

This application is theoretically for the Director of IT to analyze the IT departments help desk tickets, either for a specific year or for all time.

The first tab provides the total number of tickets, as well as, the number of open, closed and resolved tickets for the selected time frame.  It also provides a bar graph so the Director can see how long it took to close tickets in the selected timeframe.  The ticket data can also be drilled into by team member, to evaluate at the employee level.

The second tab shows the count of tickets assigned to each member of the IT team for the time period selected.

The third tab shows the percentage of tickets that came from each department within the organization.

The fourth tab shows the trend lines for the number of tickets submitted for the selected time period.  The trend information can also be drilled into and seen at the department level, as well as, at the organizational level.
