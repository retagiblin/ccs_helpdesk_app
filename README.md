# ccs_helpdesk_app

This application was developed for the class Visual Analytics in the Master of Data Science program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.  
The application uses real data from the IT deparment at a church & school where I worked for several years.  

This application is theoretically for the Director of IT to analyze the IT departments help desk tickets, either for a specific year or for all time.

The first tab provides the total number of tickets, as well as, the number of open, closed and resolved tickets for the selected time frame.  
It also provides a bar graph so the Director can see how long it took to close tickets in the selected timeframe.

The second tab shows the count of tickets assigned to each member of the IT team for the time period selected.

The third tab shows the percentage of tickets that came from each department within the organization.

The fourth tab shows the trend lines for the number of tickets submitted for the selected time period.
